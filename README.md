Dog Training App - currently in development.

This application allows you to track the progress you have been making in training your dog! Simply:

1. Register as a user
2. Add a profile for your dog
3. Add a training session each time you train your dog
4. Log in the results and track the progress over time!

Features implemented:

1. User Login
2. User Registration
3. Main Dashboard
4. Add a dog profile
5. Add a training session for a particular dog (command trained, number of trials, number of successful trials)


Features I am currently working on:

1. Displaying training progress over time per dog.
2. Adding reward, location and time of the day to monitor factors for successful training.
