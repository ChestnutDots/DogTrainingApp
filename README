Dog Training App - currently in development.

This application allows you to track the progress you have been making in training your dog! Simply:

1. Register as a user
2. Add a profile for your dog
3. Add a training session each time you train your dog
4. Log in the results and track the progress over time!

Features implemented:

1. User Login
